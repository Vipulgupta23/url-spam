# ðŸš€ Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/Vipulgupta23/url-spam.git
- Streamlit Cloud account (free at https://share.streamlit.io)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Repository
âœ… All files are already committed and pushed to GitHub
âœ… Requirements.txt is properly configured
âœ… Streamlit config is set up

### 2. Deploy on Streamlit Cloud

1. **Go to Streamlit Cloud**: https://share.streamlit.io
2. **Sign in** with your GitHub account
3. **Click "New app"**
4. **Fill in the details**:
   - **Repository**: `Vipulgupta23/url-spam`
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Main file path**: `app.py`
   - **App URL**: Choose a custom URL (e.g., `url-phishing-detector`)

5. **Click "Deploy!"**

### 3. Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`

#### Issue: "File not found" errors
**Solution**: All model files are included in the repository

#### Issue: "Memory limit exceeded"
**Solution**: The app uses efficient models and should fit within limits

#### Issue: "App crashes on startup"
**Solution**: Check the logs in Streamlit Cloud dashboard

### 4. Environment Variables (if needed)
If you need to set environment variables:
1. Go to your app dashboard
2. Click "Settings"
3. Add environment variables in "Secrets"

### 5. Monitoring
- Check app logs in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
- Monitor performance and usage
- Update dependencies as needed

## File Structure for Deployment
```

```

## Performance Optimization
- Model files are optimized for size
- Efficient feature extraction
- Caching enabled for better performance
- Minimal memory footprint

## Security Notes
- No sensitive data in the repository
- All models are pre-trained and safe
- HTTPS verification disabled for web scraping (intentional)

## Support
If deployment fails:
1. Check Streamlit Cloud logs
2. Verify all files are in the repository
3. Ensure requirements.txt is correct
4. Check for any import errors

## Success Indicators
âœ… App loads without errors
âœ… Model loads successfully
âœ… URL analysis works
âœ… Both legitimate and phishing URLs are tested
